# The Playbook For Healthy Conflict

Healthy relationships are no strangers to conflict. They just do it in a healthy way. I'm fascinated by relationships of all sorts, and in my experience, a common theme of problems I've seen in friendships, families, and romantic relationships is an inability or unwillingness to take accountability, as if we'd somehow lose something from doing so. So I've compiled (and will continue to add to) a "playbook" of sorts for how to have conflict in a healthy and comfortable way (at least as comfortable as it can be).

Of course, the earlier things are addressed, the less severe the issues will be, and so the easier the accountability is to take. But these "plays" are meant to scale to all levels. They may seem robotic, and even excessive in the case of small transgressions, but they work.

### Roles

* **Speaker:** Person who was hurt
* **Listener:** Person who hurt the Speaker
* **Bidder:** Person who is making some bid (attempt) to connect with another
* **Respondent:** Person who the Bidder is trying to connect with

## Constraints

Here's how to keep it civil.

### General Constraints

* **Maintain as neutral an affect as much as possible.** Stay calm. Use a neutral tone of voice.
* **Do not [turn away](#turning-away) from or [against](#turning-against) each other.**
* [Turn towards](#turning-towards) each other whenever possible.
* If things have been bad for a while, avoid humor (see [negative sentiment override](#negative-sentiment-override)).
* Avoid talking about intent. Impact matters more, and feels less like a critique of the other person.
* Avoid rhetorical questions. Don't ask "why...".
* Accept that each person's subjective reality is valid. Do not debate the facts (*see [contradictory responses](#contradictory-responses)*).
* Prefer "I-statements" over "you-statements" whenever possible.
* When speaking of the other person, do so in a neutral, objective manner.
* Talk about feelings in terms of positive needs, rather than negative complaints (e.g. "Here's what I felt, and here's what I needed from you.").
* Two wrongs don't make a right. Someone hurting you doesn't give you license to hurt them. If someone's response is hurtful, stop and say that, then rewind and try it again. Don't retaliate.
* What others do has an impact on our emotions, but we are each entirely responsible for how we respond to those emotions. Do not try to shift the blame on someone else for how you responded to how they made you feel.

### Listener

These are constraints the Listener should place on themselves (as difficult as it may be), to have the best possible chance of repair. These do not, however, give the Speaker license to treat the situation however they please, regardless of how hurt they are. The Speaker should respond to the Listener placing these constraints (in addition to following the [general constraints](#general-constraints)) with gratitude.

* Put whatever agendas you have on the backburner.
* Avoid explaining yourself, even when directly asked "why". Explanations before accountability are excuses, and will only hurt the Speaker more (*see [turning against](#turning-against) and [defensive responses](#defensive-responses)*).
  * Forgiveness often requires the Speaker empathize with the Listener, but explanations to facilitate that are much better received after a sincere apology is given and accepted.
  * If directly asked "why" before giving the apology, assume it's rhetorical. A safe response is "My intentions don't matter right now. Let's focus on the impact this had on you, and we can talk about my intentions later."
* Do not treat this like a zero-sum game, a debate, or a courtroom. If you do, you aren't getting a trophy for it; only a destroyed relationship and an emotionally devastated Speaker. The only way you truly win is by helping the other person win. Either you both win, or you both lose.
* If you need to take a break, set a specific time to regroup. Leave no opportunity for yourself to just not come back and avoid the conflict, nor any perception that you might do that. Not coming back on your own at a time you chose would be a massive violation of the Speaker's trust and do even more damage.
  * Don't take more than a 24 hour break.
* Don't apologize, until you can do so sincerely (see [Apologies](#apologies)).
  * It's ok to say "I want to apologize sincerely, but don't know how just yet. Let me work on something tonight so I'll bring it to you tomorrow."
* Do not shift the blame onto the Speaker. Their expectations came from somewhere. Were they explicitly established? Were they implied? Are they the result of cultural norms?
* Words are incredibly important, especially here. Choose carefully.
* You can ask for apologies too, but *after* you've given yours. Don't also immediately ask for an apology right after you've given yours. Take a break and let the apology you gave settle in as well as let the emotions die down. One conflict at a time.



# Apologies

Sincere apologies have the following criteria:

1. Take full accountability ("admit" it and that it was wrong). Be specific (e.g. "I'm sorry I did that" or "I'm sorry for how I treated you" are not specific enough).
2. Recognize the impact to the other person's emotional state.
3. Convey remorse.
4. Convey that you understand and have shared the emotional experience with the person you hurt (paraphrase it back to them).
5. Commitment to repair efforts.
6. An explanation of what behavior needs to change, commitment to changing that behavior for the better.
7. A request for forgiveness.
8. Acceptance that forgiveness may not come then, and will take effort to repair the relationship as well as your trustworthiness depending on how severe the betrayal it was.
9. Follow through on those commitments (without follow-through, the apology was insincere).

Sincere apologies are *mutually exclusive* of the following:

1. Qualifiers (e.g. "I'm sorry, but...", or "I'm sorry if...").
2. Explanations, excuses, or defensiveness.
3. Saying "I'm sorry you feel that way" ([here's why](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/the-mental-health-revolution/202203/i-m-sorry-you-feel-way-and-other-gaslighting-subtleties)).

Including these usually does more damage, and you're much better off not apologizing than including these.

If this sounds hard or uncomfortable, it's because that's what accountability feels like. Accepting it fully is scary and uncomfortable, but it's essential to maintaining a healthy relationship, helps bring us closer together emotionally, reduces our shame and guilt, and builds our self-esteem.

## General steps:

The exact order after the first three isn't super important.

### 1. Empathy

The Speaker needs to convey their emotional experience to the Listener, and the Listener needs to ask questions with the goal of sharing that emotional experience themselves. The Listener needs to put themselves in the Speaker's shoes to feel what they felt.

### 2. Validation

The Speaker needs to hear from the Listener that the Listener truly does understand what they went through. The Listener needs to paraphrase that emotional experience back to the Speaker (using similes or stories can help). This is also a good opportunity for the Listener to lay down the remorse.

If the Speaker feels they don't fully understand, they should tell the Listener, and the Listener should try to grasp what they're missing.

Steps 1 and 2 may need to be iterated over multiple times.

### 3. Accountability

#### "Admit it"

The Listener needs to take full accountability for what they did and how it impacted the Speaker, as well as state how it was wrong. This is another good place to mix in the remorse.

### 4. Commit to repair

#### "How do I make this right?"

The Listener has damaged the relationship, caused emotional harm to the Speaker, and reduced their own trustworthiness. They need to commit to putting in extra effort to repair things. That's going to take time, though, so all they can do at the time of apology is commit. But it's helpful to detail how

### 5. Request [forgiveness](#forgiveness)

#### "Can you ever forgive me?"

The Listener shouldn't expect [forgiveness](#forgiveness). They should instead ask for it, accepting that they will possibly be denied. Being denied it in that moment though does not necessarily mean that it is off the table. The Speaker may simply need time to calm down or heal, or they may have things the forgiveness is contingent upon.

### 6. Meaningful change

The Listener's behavior could've been a one-off. Or not. Either way, it's important that the Listener doesn't just go around causing damage and then patching trying to patch it up afterwards. They need to actually *learn* from their mistakes. They need to make meaningful changes to their behavior to prevent this from happening again.

### Putting it all together

It might seem excessive, but in big conflicts, anything less than all this is dismissive of the Speaker's emotional experience. It's best not to take any chances and go through it all, especially if you don't want to hurt the Speaker.

Let's see what that looks like altogether. These may seem excessive, but try to put yourself in the Speaker's shoes going by what the Listener says, and then imagine how it would feel to be given the associated apology.

#### Example 1

> "I'm so sorry I yelled at you while you were trying to tell me how I hurt you. That was so cruel of me, and made you feel so much more hurt, rejected, and alone. I shouldn't have gotten defensive, let alone lashed out at you with belligerence and contemptuous insults. I should have just taken accountability then, and I feel like a villain for saying such hurtful things to you. You deserved so much better than that. I need to be much calmer when you try to tell me how I made you feel, and I will be going forward."

Notice the specific behaviors being listed, and the Listener calling them out as wrong. How they address the emotional impact by naming emotions and even the degree to which they were felt. Notice the remorse and how they acknowledge what they should've done better.

Also notice how the Listener didn't try to excuse their behavior by talking about their own emotional experience or their side of things. By not doing so, they avoided dismissing the Speaker's emotions.

#### Example 2

> "I'm so sorry I missed your birthday, especially after you were so thoughtful and threw that surprise party for me with all my friends. I know I told you I would spend yours with you, and you were really looking forward to spending that time with me. I even made a big deal about how bad it would be to not do my part for you. But I never showed up and even ignored your messages, and you spent that day alone and hurt because of me. That must have been devastating for you, and you must have felt like I didn't care for you at all. God, I feel so awful. Like I tricked you with all my considerate promises. That was so awful of me. Please, let me make it up to you. Let's spend this weekend doing something fun, whatever you wanna do. I have to run to the pharmacy in the morning, but let's do it right after that. I know it won't make up entirely for what I did, but I still want to do what I can to make this right. And I promise I'll never miss your birthday again. I'm making sure I have reoccurring reminders in my calendar now so I'll know when it's coming up."

Notice how the Listener turns towards the Speaker by taking the time to express gratitude and appreciation for what the Speaker did for them. This can go a long way towards rebuilding the connection between the two.

Notice again the specific behaviors and emotions and how their actions were wrong. They also express remorse by going into how they helped establish and built up those expectations and how they effectively "tricked" the Speaker into getting their hopes up, only to be left alone.

This Listener also didn't explain themselves.

They also took the initiative to make repairs, setting the date themselves, tempering expectations alongside providing transparency (telling them where they would be and implying they'd want to do it even sooner). In addition, they expressed an understanding that they can't just do a patch job later to make up for it and that real damage was done. And they also committed to changing their behavior going forward, demonstrating exactly how they were going to do that.

# Terminology

### Forgiveness

Forgiveness is a conscious choice to no longer hold a transgression against someone in the sense that the forgiver no longer seeks out vengeance and has let go of their anger. It does *not* mean reconciliation. Nor does it mean the Listener is trusted again.

### Negative sentiment override

A state in which a person has an overwhelming negative feeling about the relationship that overrides positive events happening in the moment. Negative events are more negative. Neutral, and even positive events are also more likely to be perceived as negative.

They may feel so distressed they become hypervigilant, oversensitive to insult, and even paranoid. This is typically caused by the person's bids to connect being [turned away](#turning-away) from repeatedly by the other person. If a person is already in this state, it's likely things have been bad for a while.

### Positive sentiment override

The opposite of [negative sentiment override](#negative-sentiment-override), to the point where even negative events can be seen as positive.

## Turning towards, away from, and against

When someone makes a bid for a connection, we have 3 ways we can respond. In healthy relationships of all sorts (platonic, romantic, etc), there should be vastly more turning towards than away and against put together (5 times as much, in fact).

The intentions behind turning away or against don't matter, as the message they send to the bidder is the same. See below for more details on what those messages are.

----------

### Turning towards

These should be the target at all times.

Even when someone is approaching in an aggressive or hostile manner, turning towards is the fastest way to both calm and reassure them. It's tempting to phrase this as "taking the wind out of their sails", but that implies their being placed at a disadvantage. In reality, it's giving them an advantage alongside our trust in a way that says "You're hurt. I'm here with you now. Let's solve this. Together."

##### Nearly passive responses

These responses can be one- or two-word comments, or a mild shift in behavior with no verbal response. The person responding may not stop what he or she is doing to interact with you, but at least you know that you've been heard.

##### Low-energy response

Responses involving a few words or a question to clarify the bid.

##### Attentive response

Responses often involving opinions, thoughts, and feelings.

##### High-energy responses

Responses involving full attention with good eye contact. High-energy responses are usually enthusiastic.

#### The messages these responses send:

* I hear you.
* I'm interested in you.
* I understand you (or would like to).
* I'm on your side.
* I'd like to help you (whether I can or not).
* I'd like to be with you (whether I can or not).
* I accept you (even if I don't accept all your behavior).

----------

### Turning away

These responses aren't quite "mean" like [turning against](#turning-against) is, but they are emotionally devastating to the bidder when the respondent starts making a habit out of it. Failed bids are rarely, if ever, made again.

These are tempting to rely on, when we don't want to have uncomfortable conversations (especially when we aren't even consciously aware that we should be having those conversations), but relying on them is the fastest way to destroy a relationship (yes, even faster than [turning against](#turning-against) habitually).

#### Types

##### Preoccupied responses

Responses in which the respondent is often involved in an activity, such as reading or watching television.

##### Disregarding responses

Responses in which the bid is completely ignored or the would-be respondent focuses on insignificant details of the bid.

##### Interrupting responses

Responses in which the respondent introduces unrelated matters or counterbids.

#### The messages these responses send:

* I don't care about your bid.
* I want to avoid your bid.
* I'm not interested in your interests.
* I've got more important things on my mind.
* I'm too busy to pay attention to your bid.
* Your bid is not worth my time.
* I want to be more independent than you want me to be.

----------

### Turning against:

These responses aren't just hurtful. They're *mean* and uncalled for. They're attacks, even if the respondent doesn't think of them as such. Even if the bidder is approaching in a seemingly aggressive way, this type of response will only make things worse. An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind, and as mentioned above, turning towards in such a context yields far better results.

These types of responses can either cause the bidder to become angrier, or make them anxious and afraid. In the former case, things will likely cascade, building up and up. In the latter case, the bidder will likely shutdown and simply avoid conflict and suppress their feelings. Both of these scenarios should be avoided by turning towards instead.

#### Types

##### Contemptuous responses

Responses that entail hurtful disrespecting comments aimed at the person bidding for connection. Such putdowns are often delivered with an air of superiority, as if the respondent wants to put some distance between themselves and the bidder, and intentional insults will do the trick.

##### Belligerent responses

Responses that are provocative or combative. You get the sense the respondent is looking for a fight. They would argue with whatever the bidder says, regardless of content. Belligerent responses often involve unfair teasing or a (sometimes implied) dare (e.g. "what did you expect?").

##### Contradictory responses

Responses in which a person seems intent on starting a debate or argument (e.g. playing devil's advocate with the bidder's emotional experience and debating the "facts"). This is less hostile than a belligerent response, but it still blocks the bidder's attempt to connect.

##### Domineering responses

Responses that involve attempts to control another person. The respondent's goal is to get the bidder to withdraw, retreat, or submit. You often hear a parental message in these responses, whether the respondent is a parental figure or not (e.g. things like them implying they know what's best for you).

##### Critical responses

Responses that are broad-based attacks on a bidder's character. They're different from a complain, which focuses on a particular event or specific behavior. When people are being critical, they frequently speak in global terms, saying things like "you always..." and "you never..." Often you'll hear statements of blame or betrayal in these responses.

##### Defensive responses

These responses create a sense of separation by allowing the respondent to relinquish responsibility for matters at hand. If the bidder is upset about something, the respondent may act like an innocent victim of misplaced blame.

#### The messages these responses send:

* Your need for attention makes me angry.
* I feel hostile toward you.
* I don't respect you.
* I don't value you or this relationship.
* I want to hurt you.
* I want to drive you away.
