# The Guidebook For Healthy Conflict

Conflict is something many people aren't taught how to navigate in a healthy way, and I've seen this go awry far too often. It's hard to know what's fair and what we're entitled to as fellow human beings from each other, especially when there are common strategies for avoiding accountability such as gaslighting. But a lot of these terms get thrown around a lot, lessening their significance and mudying the waters.

But how to handle it in a healthy, productive way is far from a mystery. So I'm hoping this can serve as a resource to help anyone that needs it by getting this information out in a publicly available (and hopefully easily ingestible) way. Through this, I hope to reduce the amount of unnecessarily tragic handling of conflict, even if by only a small amount.
